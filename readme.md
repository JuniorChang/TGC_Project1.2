<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> As cases of covid is getting higher everyday, the strain on the healthcare
system is very high. In order not to breakdown the healthcare system and at the same 
time giving sick patients timely medical advice is important.
</P> <br>

<p> A series of questions to understand the client's current situation and will advice 
them if they should stay at home, visit a clinic near them or in the worst case scenario, visit a hospital. </p> <br>

<p> Next we will help them check if their current residential place is eligible for home stay recovery. Again, a simple quiz to understand their situation and my script will determine if their house are eligible. </p>

<h1> Testing </h1>

Photos of website responsiveness for different mobile devices was done.
It was tested on <a href="  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#"> ami.responsivedesign.is <a>

For risk.html, if the count of yes if lesser or equal to 2, they will be shown safe to stay at home with a green danger metre.
If the count of yes is 3 or 4, they will be shown a yellow danger metre and be adviced to visit a clinic.
If the count of yes is 5, the danger metre shown to them will be red and they will be adviced to visit a hospital.

In stayhome.html, if their yes count is 5, they will be shown a green tick and an alert will tell the user that their resident is eligible for home stay recovery.
However if the yes count is less than 5, they will be shown a red cross and a alert will inform them that their resident is not eligible for home stay recovery.
